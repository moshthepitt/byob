# BYOB

## Build Your Own Bot (BYOB) is a Solana web application to create atomic transactions using Versioned Transactions.

Utilising the power of Lookup Tables (LUTs) it is possible to chain together different actions into one atomic transaction, where if one element in the transaction fails, the whole chain of actions fail.

Additionally, because everything is happening inside one transaction, it is possible to utilise advanced defi products such as flash loans. An example use case is to instantly lever up or down on Degenbox strategies.
